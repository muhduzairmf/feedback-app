This Feedback app is the one of the my practices to enchance my knowledge in Svelte Framework. This Feedback App can receive feedback and rating from client and display it immediately after submit. However, it is only work in client side, which is not integration with any backend solution.


Thanks to the [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) to guide this tutorial, which is I was followed along the [Svelte Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVy6GdtNuQ) on his YouTube channel.


This Feedback app was built on top of Svelte + Vite.
